# deep_loop

deep_loop contains utilities to predict the instantaneous amplitude and phase of a signal in a specific frequency band under causal conditions, using the unfiltered broadband signal as an input. The repository contains code for end-to-end training of neural networks in Keras, given training data where amplitude or phase are extracted from the broadband input using digital acausal filtering. The projected and intended use lies in real-time prediction on local field potentials (LFP), which serve as a signature of oscillatory brain activity. Experimentalists can thus deliver stimuli in a manner that is conditional on the isntantaneous amplitude or phase of a band-limited oscillations within the broadband LFP signal.
